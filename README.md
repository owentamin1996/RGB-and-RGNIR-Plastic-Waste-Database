# Overview
Plastic waste is a growing environmental concern, and while recycling is a potential solution, accurate sorting is crucial. Spectral imaging can differentiate between different types of plastic based on their spectral signatures, but it has several limitations. Machine learning is a promising approach for plastic waste management, but it requires a comprehensive database. To address this, a database of plastic waste images captured using RGB and RGNIR channels has been created. The database is introduced by the authors and makes it accessible to researchers for plastic waste detection purposes. The database serves as a foundation for testing automatic sorting methods and enables a comparison of the effectiveness of various machine learning techniques using both colour spaces.

# Dataset
This repository contains a dataset of RGB and RGNIR images that we collected, consisting of 405 images each. The pictures were taken in public areas like beaches and riverbanks and captured using an iPhone 12 for RGB and Mapir Survey3W for RGNIR. We have resized the images to 415 x 415 pixels, which is optimal for machine learning models to train.
